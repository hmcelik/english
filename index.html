      <h1>Origins</h1>
      <p>
        After the French Revolution, the foundation of the nationalist rhetoric
        was sown among the populace which called for a unified nation consisting
        of one and one race only. Since at the time, all jewish communities
        throughout Europe were minorities in country consisting of other
        nationalities, they quickly became the target for atrocities and mass
        murder. The prominence of these movements depended on the state of the
        ever-changing nature of the French government at the time. France become
        a monarchy again after the conclusion of the Napoleonic wars, during
        which republican values were suppressed heavily and the calls for a
        unified ethno-state were rendered powerless. However, the monarchy
        collapsed after the revolutions of 1848 leading to the creation of the
        Second French Republic.

        During the second republic and later the second empire(which were both
        led by the same person) the anti-semitic movements failed to gather much
        support as a direct result of Emperor Napoleon III’s favorable views
        towards them. However, another side of Fascism originated during the
        Second Empire. France’s overseas and European Imperial ambitions rose to
        an all time high during this era, culminating in the French Invasion of
        Mexico and the Franco-Prussian war. After the Franco-Prussian war which
        led to the downfall of the Empire and the declaration of the Third
        Republic, the French ideological mindset changed drastically. This
        change in views was partly due to the resentment the new government held
        towards Napoleon III and partly due to the loss of Alsace-Lorraine, a
        part of the french mainland. The desire to take the region back and find
        a new French Empire with the help of overseas territories led to the
        height of French Imperialism during this time, with the nationalist
        rhetoric spreading through political circles like wildfire. All of these
        laid the foundations for the fascist mindset for the coming years, and
        led to the French acquisition of territories such as most of Western
        Sub-Saharan Africa and Indochina. However, the most prominent and famous
        event that is remembered with the characteristics of this era is the
        Dreyfus Affair.
