          After the French Revolution, the foundation of the nationalist
          rhetoric was sown among the populace which called for a unified nation
          consisting of one and one race only. Since at the time, all jewish
          communities throughout Europe were minorities in country consisting of
          other nationalities, they quickly became the target for atrocities and
          mass murder. The prominence of these movements depended on the state
          of the ever-changing nature of the French government at the time.
          France become a monarchy again after the conclusion of the Napoleonic
          wars, during which republican values were suppressed heavily and the
          calls for a unified ethno-state were rendered powerless. However, the
          monarchy collapsed after the revolutions of 1848 leading to the
          creation of the Second French Republic.

          During the second republic and later the second empire(which were both
          led by the same person) the anti-semitic movements failed to gather
          much support as a direct result of Emperor Napoleon III’s favorable
          views towards them. However, another side of Fascism originated during
          the Second Empire. France’s overseas and European Imperial ambitions
          rose to an all time high during this era, culminating in the French
          Invasion of Mexico and the Franco-Prussian war. After the
          Franco-Prussian war which led to the downfall of the Empire and the
          declaration of the Third Republic, the French ideological mindset
          changed drastically. This change in views was partly due to the
          resentment the new government held towards Napoleon III and partly due
          to the loss of Alsace-Lorraine, a part of the french mainland. The
          desire to take the region back and find a new French Empire with the
          help of overseas territories led to the height of French Imperialism
          during this time, with the nationalist rhetoric spreading through
          political circles like wildfire. All of these laid the foundations for
          the fascist mindset for the coming years, and led to the French
          acquisition of territories such as most of Western Sub-Saharan Africa
          and Indochina. However, the most prominent and famous event that is
          remembered with the characteristics of this era is the Dreyfus Affair.

          The Dreyfus Affair is a series of events leading to the French
          military high command accusing a low ranking Jewish officer for spying
          for the German Army despite having no proof of it whatsoever. The
          ensuing trials which took years only proved how deep the anti-semitic
          roots were in the army to the public and Alfred Dreyfus was found
          guilty at first and spent many years of his life in a prison, serving
          for a crime he had no connection to. However, despite this injustice,
          a portion of the public stood up for Dreyfus, which was the major
          reason for his pardon in the following years. Despite the considerable
          backlash from the public, this infamous series of events is shown to
          be one of the first stepping stone for the rise of French Fascism.

          The prominence of French Fascism was rather miniscule before the
          outbreak of WW2. With the fall of France to Nazi occupation, extremist
          right wing groups under the senior war hero Philippe Petain were
          brought to high ranking positions in the newly created puppet stated
          centered around the town of Vichy. This so called “French State” more
          commonly known by the public as Vichy France held no actual power and
          was rather used as a way for the Third Reich to have a form of control
          over the French people. While it was true that it didn’t hold any
          political or militaristic power(besides the paramilitary force called
          the “Milice”), the Vichy government worked as a tool to refine the
          French Fascist ideology which showed remarkable similarities to German
          Fascism, such as the call for the extermination of Jews and the
          formation of an ideologically and ethnically uniform state.

      <h1>Downfall and Legacy</h1>
      <div class="bam">
        <p>
          After the fall of the Vichy government in late 1944, the French
          Fascist movement went somewhat underground and was forced to evolve in
          secrecy under many varying political organizations, and its major
          opponent went from Jews and other “undesireables” to ethnicities such
          as Algerians and other Muslims with the oncoming wave of immigrations
          from former French colonies. However, the ideology seems to have
          somewhat resurfaced in these last years with the Syrian refugee crisis
          fueling anti-muslim sentiment in the country. The ideology seems to be
          rallying around Marine Le Pen in a more watered down version hiding
          behind the guise of “nationalism” . As of now, it is too soon to say
          what the future of the far-right movement will be in France.
